Client debriefing 

Project overview
My name Christopher Willems, and I was given an assignment on 2 September 2023 by Myrna de Wit, representing the Dagelijkse bedrijfsvoering at De Hallen. The task at hand is to develop a website that can host community initiatives .
The general plan is to introduce a system that binds the community around the De Hallen, and that  reinforces De Hallen as a community centre in west. This project is due on 11 October 2023. 

Goals
De Hallen envisions a platform that bridges the gap between their neighbourhood and the local labour market in West Amsterdam. This includes a marketplace where the community can offer services among each other and connect to all the events and initiatives within De Hallen and the surrounding neighbourhood.
From the briefing it seemed that Myrna was inspired by the concept ”buurtcampus oost”, and wants to adopt the same sentiment to cement De Hallen as a buurtcentrum in west. 

However at the moment it seems that they themselves don’t have a definitive explanation of what the end result of this concept should look like,  And don’t want to convey  that the website is led solely by the organisation De Hallen. They prefer that this initiative is seen as a collaborative effort.

Approach
So because of the ambiguity, our approach is to create a platform that is flexible and modular enough that in time it can evolve to align closely with the community's needs and De Hallen's objectives. The approach includes the following elements:

•	The website will shows events and services that are ongoing in the area based on the users interest.

•	It will slightly adopt the aesthetic identity of De Hallen.

•	It should be easily accessible, ensuring ease of use for all community members.

•	It will have a dynamic and playful interface that represents the area.

•	It should be capable to add or remove features to fit the needs of the community and the goals of De Hallen.


To conclude, we would like to take on this assignment and do our best to create a product that aligns with the vision of De Hallen and the community it serves.
